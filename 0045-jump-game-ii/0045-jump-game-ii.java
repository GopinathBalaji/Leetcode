// Explanation
// furthest always tracks the best place you could land with one more jump.
// When i hits currentEnd, you know thereâ€™s no way to reach beyond it without spending another jump, so you increment jumps and extend currentEnd to that furthest.
// You stop as soon as currentEnd reaches the last index, guaranteeing that jumps is the minimum number needed.
